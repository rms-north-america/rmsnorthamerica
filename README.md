## Setup

Below are the steps required to use this starter for a new project:

1. In GitHub, create a new repository by importing a clone of this repository.
2. In Netlify, click on the "New site from Git" button and select the newly created repository.
3. In Contentful, create a new space for the project.
4. In Contentful, go to Settings -> API keys and copy the "Space ID" and the "Content Delivery API - access token" and paste it into a .env file within the local copy of the new project's repository.
5. In Netlify, add the same "Space ID" and "Content Delivery API - access token" as environment variables under Settings -> Build & deploy -> Environment.
